HOW TO USE
In XAMPP:
- Place CQ3 folder in htdocs
- Start MYSQL Database
- Start Apache Web Server

In browser:
- import files from db_scripts into phpmyadmin (localhost/phpmyadmin)
- run localhost/CQ3/event.php
- go to index.html (localhost/CQ3/)
- use checkboxes to add data

Technologies Used:
- Angular
- PHP (using XAMPP)
- JavaScript
- JSON
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

Comments
- First time using PHP
- Google put to good use (mainly Stackoverflow)
- Output SQL tables to JSON, because I couldn't figure out how to show all data after joining all tables together
- Output bulk data to separate PHP files, because the queries were interfering with other bulk data and specific event id data
